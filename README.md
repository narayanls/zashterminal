**Zashterminal** is a modern, intuitive, and innovative terminal built with GTK4 and Adwaita. It blends powerful features for developers and system administrators with a welcoming experience for newcomers. Simplified session management, an integrated file manager, automatic color highlighting, and workflow-focused tools make the command line more productive on any Linux distribution.

## Why Zashterminal

- **Focused on real workflows**: Manage SSH/SFTP sessions, panes, and layouts without leaving the terminal.
- **Accessible by design**: Clear UI, smart defaults, and discoverable actions help beginners get started faster.
- **Optional AI assistance**: Only the text you explicitly select is sent, keeping control and privacy in your hands.
- **Built on modern Linux UI**: GTK4 + libadwaita for a native, responsive desktop experience.

## SecureCRT Migration & PAM Compatibility

No more excuses to postpone your migration to Zashterminal:

- **Import SecureCRT sessions directly from the main menu** (`Import SecureCRT Sessions`).
- **Bulk import from full directory trees** (folders + `.ini` sessions).
- **SecureCRT Password V2 compatibility**: Zashterminal can import and use `Password V2` entries (`02:<hex>`), keeping credentials compatible with the Zashterminal session format.
- **Balabit/One Identity gateway compatibility**: Zashterminal supports keyboard-interactive privileged access gateway flows commonly used in Balabit environments.

About Balabit and One Identity:

- Balabit products were integrated into **One Identity** and the Balabit brand was gradually discontinued.
- Example: *Balabit Shell Control Box* became **One Identity Safeguard for Privileged Sessions**.
- One Identity links:
  - Company: https://www.oneidentity.com/
  - Privileged Access Management (PAM): https://www.oneidentity.com/br-pt/privileged-access-management/

One Identity Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions help reduce security risk and support compliance, available both on-prem and SaaS. They provide control, monitoring, analysis, and governance for privileged access across multiple environments and platforms, including Zero Trust and least-privilege operational models.

Zashterminal creates a bridge between your shell and Large Language Models (LLMs), offering an **optional** and fully **non-intrusive** AI experience. The assistant only processes the content that **you explicitly select and choose to send**, ensuring full control over your privacy.
* **Multi-Provider Support**: Native integration with **Groq**, **Google Gemini**, **OpenRouter**, and **Local LLMs** (Ollama/LM Studio).
* **Context Aware**: The AI understands your OS and distribution context to provide accurate and relevant commands.
* **Chat Panel**: A dedicated side panel for persistent conversations, command suggestions, and "Click-to-Run" code snippets.
* **Smart Suggestions**: Ask how to perform tasks and receive ready-to-execute commands directly in the UI.


### 📂 Advanced File Manager & Remote Editing

-   **Integrated Side Panel**: Browse local and remote file systems without leaving the terminal.
-   **Remote Editing**: Click to edit remote files (SSH/SFTP) in your favorite local editor. Zashterm watches the file and automatically uploads changes on save.
-   **Drag & Drop Transfer**: Upload files to remote servers simply by dragging them into the terminal window over (SFTP/Rsync)
-   **Transfer Manager**: Track uploads and downloads with a detailed progress manager and history.

-   **Input Broadcasting**: Type commands in one terminal and execute them simultaneously across multiple selected tabs/panes.
-   **Quick Prompts**: One-click AI prompts for common tasks (e.g., "Explain this error", "Optimize this command").


### 🖥️ Core Terminal Functionality
-   **Session Management**: Save, organize (with folders), and launch Local, SSH, and SFTP sessions.
-   **Flexible Layouts**: Split panes horizontally and vertically; save and restore complex window layouts.
-   **Directory Tracking**: Updates tab titles automatically based on the current working directory (OSC7 support).
-   **Deep Customization**: Visual theme editor, font sizing, transparency (window and headerbar), and extensive keyboard shortcuts.


## Dependencies
To build and run Zashterminal, you will need:

-   **Python 3.9+**
-   **GTK4** and **Adwaita 1.0+** (`libadwaita`)
-   **VTE for GTK4** (`vte4` >= 0.76 recommended)
-   **Python Libraries**:
    -   `PyGObject` (GTK bindings)
    -   `pycryptodomex` (SecureCRT-compatible password encryption/decryption)
    -   `requests` (For AI API connectivity)
    -   `pygments` (For syntax highlighting)
    -   `psutil` (Optional, for advanced process tracking)
    -   `regex` (Optional, for high-performance highlighting patterns)

## Installation (works on any distro)

### Arch/Manjaro

AUR (recommended on Arch-based systems):
```bash
yay -S zashterminal        # or
paru -S zashterminal
```

Local installer (same flow used on other distros, system-wide with venv):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoberbert/zashterminal/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Debian / Ubuntu / Fedora / openSUSE / others

The installer detects the distro, installs the required system packages, and installs Zashterminal system-wide using a virtual environment in `/opt/zashterminal/venv`.

```bash
# Quick install (no clone required)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoberbert/zashterminal/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash

# Alternatively, download and run
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoberbert/zashterminal/refs/heads/main/install.sh
bash install.sh
```

### WSL on Windows (Experimental)

Zashterminal can run on WSL, but this is still **experimental** and may present issues depending on your WSLg/graphics/input setup.

- Tested environment: **Ubuntu 24.04 on WSL**
- Installation method: same Debian/Ubuntu flow using `install.sh`

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoberbert/zashterminal/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

If you use a language other than English (default), configure locale and keyboard (example for Brazilian Portuguese):

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
export LANG=pt_BR.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=pt_BR.UTF-8
export LANGUAGE=pt_BR:pt
```

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install x11-xkb-utils
setxkbmap br
```

Also add to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
if [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then
    setxkbmap br
fi
```

After changing your `~/.bashrc`, close WSL completely and open it again.

## Usage

```bash
zashterminal [options] [directory]
```
